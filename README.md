# Multi Robot Task Assignment
A Multi-Robot Task Assignment Framework for Search and Rescue with Heterogeneous Teams

In the MRTA_new folder:

Running main.py assigns the tasks to the robots and saves the results in the MRTA.hdf5 file. 

Running a_star.py visualizes the robot movements to the victims (tasks)


In the MASAR folder:

Running env1.1.py trains the agents to find the victims and saves the results in multi_agent_Q_learnnig_{experiment name}.hdf5 file

Runnning visualizer1.1.py demonstrates the robots performance in a simulation


In the PathPanning folder:

Running a_star.py visualizes the robots paths in hte environment
